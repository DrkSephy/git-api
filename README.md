Repository for exploring Github's API: https://developer.github.com/v3/

Goals
=====

The end goal is to build something similar to Technetium: http://technetium.herokuapp.com/
This requires the following data: 
    
* Given a repository, return the number of commits made by each contributor.
* Given a repository, return the number of comments made by each contributor. This includes 
  comments made on code as well as issues. 
* Given a repository, return the number of pull requests made by each contributor. 
* Given a repository, return the number of lines of code made by each contributor. 

While most of this data is already provided by Github, these scripts will help with building
our application.
